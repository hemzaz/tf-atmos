# Claude Commands for Terraform/Atmos Infrastructure

This directory contains Claude-specific command shortcuts for common infrastructure development workflows. These are optimized for Claude Code usage but can be referenced by developers as well.

## Available Commands

### 🔍 **Status & Diagnostics**
- [`check-infrastructure-status.md`](check-infrastructure-status.md) - Get comprehensive infrastructure status
- [`troubleshoot-common-issues.md`](troubleshoot-common-issues.md) - Solutions for frequent problems

### ✅ **Validation & Planning** 
- [`validate-infrastructure.md`](validate-infrastructure.md) - Validate configurations safely
- [`plan-infrastructure-changes.md`](plan-infrastructure-changes.md) - Preview changes before applying

### 🚀 **Deployment & Management**
- [`apply-infrastructure-changes.md`](apply-infrastructure-changes.md) - Apply changes to infrastructure
- [`onboard-new-environment.md`](onboard-new-environment.md) - Create new environments

### 🐳 **Development Environment**
- [`start-development-environment.md`](start-development-environment.md) - Start local development stack

## Usage in Claude Code

When working with Claude Code, you can reference these commands:

```
"Help me validate the infrastructure" 
→ Claude will reference validate-infrastructure.md

"I need to troubleshoot an AWS credential issue"
→ Claude will reference troubleshoot-common-issues.md

"How do I plan infrastructure changes safely?"
→ Claude will reference plan-infrastructure-changes.md
```

## Command Structure

Each command file includes:
- **What this does** - Clear explanation of the command's purpose
- **Commands to run** - Specific bash commands with examples
- **Expected output** - What you should see when successful
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Safety notes** - Important warnings for destructive operations

## Quick Reference

### Most Used Commands
```bash
make doctor          # System diagnostics
make status          # Infrastructure status
make validate        # Validate configurations
make plan           # Preview changes (safe)
make apply          # Apply changes (with confirmation)
gaia quick-start    # Interactive getting started guide
```

### Emergency Commands
```bash
make doctor                    # Diagnose issues
gaia troubleshoot             # Get help with problems
make dev-reset               # Reset development environment
aws sts get-caller-identity  # Check AWS credentials
```

### Development Workflow
1. `make status` - Check current state
2. Make your infrastructure changes
3. `make validate` - Ensure configurations are valid
4. `make plan` - Review what will change
5. `make apply` - Apply changes (with confirmation)
6. `make status` - Verify final state

## Integration with Main Tooling

These commands integrate with:
- **Makefile** - Main task runner with shortcuts
- **Gaia CLI** - Enhanced Python wrapper for Atmos
- **Atmos** - Core infrastructure orchestration tool
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as code engine

## Customization

You can customize these commands by:
1. Editing the markdown files directly
2. Adding new command files following the same structure
3. Updating the main Makefile to include new shortcuts
4. Extending the Gaia CLI with new functions

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Start with `make doctor` for system diagnostics
2. Check `troubleshoot-common-issues.md` for common solutions
3. Review logs in the `logs/` directory
4. Consult the main documentation in `docs/`
