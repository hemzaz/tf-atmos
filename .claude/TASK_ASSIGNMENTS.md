# Task Assignments for IDP Evolution

## Agent Assignment Strategy

This document assigns specific tasks to specialized agents based on their expertise and the nature of the work required.

## Task Categories & Agent Mapping

### 🔒 Security Tasks → **DevOps Troubleshooter Agent**
**Rationale**: Security requires deep understanding of attack vectors, compliance requirements, and production debugging capabilities.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Tasks → **Cloud Architect Agent**
**Rationale**: Infrastructure design requires knowledge of AWS services, scaling patterns, and architectural best practices.

### 🐍 Python Development → **Python Pro Agent**  
**Rationale**: Python code requires understanding of best practices, testing, performance optimization, and modern development patterns.

### 🚀 Deployment & CI/CD → **Deployment Engineer Agent**
**Rationale**: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and deployment strategies require specialized DevOps knowledge.

### 🔧 Terraform Optimization → **Terraform Specialist Agent**
**Rationale**: Terraform code quality, modules, state management require deep Terraform expertise.

### 🌐 General Research & Analysis → **General Purpose Agent**
**Rationale**: Requirements analysis, documentation, and cross-domain tasks benefit from broad knowledge.
