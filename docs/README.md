# Terraform-Atmos Infrastructure Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive information on using and extending the Terraform-Atmos infrastructure framework. The framework is designed to be robust, resilient to human error, and provide clear guidance on best practices.

## Safety Features

The codebase includes numerous safeguards to prevent common errors:

1. **Extensive Input Validation**:
   - All components include comprehensive validation blocks to ensure proper input formatting
   - Required fields are explicitly checked before operations begin
   - Type checking prevents incorrect data types

2. **Preconditions**:
   - Terraform lifecycle blocks with preconditions verify requirements before execution
   - Prevent operations that would break infrastructure dependencies
   - Enforce high availability standards (e.g., minimum replica counts)

3. **Timeouts**:
   - Extended timeouts for slow operations like certificate validation
   - Configurable timeouts based on environment size

4. **Fail-Safe Defaults**:
   - Conservative default values prioritize safety over convenience
   - Operational components default to high availability settings
   - Security settings default to most restrictive state

5. **Cross-Checks**:
   - Workflows validate state before execution
   - Required dependencies checked before component installation

6. **Clear Error Messages**:
   - Descriptive error messages with actionable remediation steps
   - Context-aware validation provides targeted feedback
   - Links to documentation for error resolution

7. **Automation and Guardrails**:
   - Scripts include built-in validation before execution
   - Certificate management has robust error handling
   - Secrets handling includes permissions verification
