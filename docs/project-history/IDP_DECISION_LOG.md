# IDP Platform Decision Log & Conflict Resolution

## Active Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. API Architecture Pattern
**Status**: PENDING RESOLUTION

| Aspect | Option A: GraphQL-First | Option B: REST + GraphQL | Option C: REST-Only |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Advocate** | backend-architect | deployment-engineer | - |
| **Pros** | - Single endpoint<br>- Flexible queries<br>- Type safety<br>- Real-time subscriptions | - Gradual migration<br>- Better caching<br>- Simpler debugging<br>- Industry standard | - Simplest implementation<br>- Well understood<br>- Easy caching |
| **Cons** | - Learning curve<br>- Complex caching<br>- N+1 query issues | - Dual maintenance<br>- Complexity<br>- Confusion for devs | - Multiple round trips<br>- Over/under fetching<br>- No real-time |
| **Accessibility Impact** | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |
| **Performance Impact** | Better for complex queries | Balanced | Better for simple queries |
| **Developer Experience** | Better once learned | More options | Familiar |
| **Recommendation** | **Selected** - GraphQL for complex queries, REST for simple CRUD | | |

**Resolution Rationale**: Hybrid approach leverages strengths of both patterns. REST for simple operations maintains familiarity, while GraphQL handles complex service catalog queries efficiently.

### 2. Frontend State Management
**Status**: RESOLVED

| Aspect | Option A: Redux Toolkit | Option B: Context + Hooks | Option C: MobX |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Advocate** | - | frontend-developer | - |
| **Pros** | - Predictable state<br>- DevTools<br>- Time travel | - Built into React<br>- Simpler setup<br>- Less boilerplate | - Less boilerplate<br>- Reactive<br>- Class support |
| **Cons** | - Boilerplate<br>- Learning curve<br>- Overkill for simple state | - Performance issues at scale<br>- No time travel | - Magic behaviors<br>- Less community |
| **Accessibility Impact** | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |
| **Performance Impact** | Good with memoization | Can cause re-renders | Good |
| **Developer Experience** | Steeper learning curve | Familiar to React devs | Different paradigm |
| **Recommendation** | | **Selected** - Use Context for global state, local state for components | |

**Resolution Rationale**: Backstage already uses Context patterns. Maintaining consistency with the framework reduces cognitive load.

### 3. Container Orchestration for Local Development
**Status**: RESOLVED

| Aspect | Option A: Docker Compose | Option B: Kind (K8s in Docker) | Option C: Minikube |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Advocate** | deployment-engineer | cloud-architect | - |
| **Pros** | - Simple setup<br>- Fast startup<br>- Low resources<br>- Easy debugging | - Production parity<br>- Real K8s APIs<br>- Multi-node support | - Production parity<br>- Addons ecosystem<br>- VM isolation |
| **Cons** | - Not real K8s<br>- Different configs<br>- No K8s features | - More complex<br>- Resource heavy<br>- Slower startup | - Resource intensive<br>- Platform specific<br>- Slow |
| **Resource Requirements** | 4GB RAM | 8GB RAM | 8GB RAM |
| **Developer Experience** | Best for beginners | Best for K8s users | Good for testing |
| **Recommendation** | **Selected** - Default for local dev | Optional for K8s testing | |

**Resolution Rationale**: Lower barrier to entry is critical for adoption. Developers can optionally use Kind for K8s-specific testing.

### 4. Secrets Management Strategy
**Status**: PENDING RESOLUTION

| Aspect | Option A: HashiCorp Vault | Option B: AWS Secrets Manager | Option C: External Secrets Operator |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Advocate** | cloud-architect | deployment-engineer | backend-architect |
| **Pros** | - Multi-cloud<br>- Dynamic secrets<br>- Fine-grained policies | - Native AWS<br>- Simple integration<br>- Automatic rotation | - K8s native<br>- Multiple backends<br>- GitOps friendly |
| **Cons** | - Complex setup<br>- Another system<br>- Operational overhead | - AWS lock-in<br>- Cost per secret<br>- Limited features | - K8s only<br>- Extra operator<br>- Complexity |
| **Security Impact** | Highest | High | High |
| **Operational Complexity** | High | Low | Medium |
| **Cost** | License + Infrastructure | $0.40/secret/month | Infrastructure only |
| **Recommendation** | For enterprise | **Selected** - For initial implementation | For K8s workloads |

**Resolution Rationale**: Start with AWS Secrets Manager for simplicity, migrate to Vault if multi-cloud becomes a requirement.

---

### 5. Service Mesh Selection
**Status**: RESOLVED

| Aspect | Option A: Istio | Option B: AWS App Mesh | Option C: Linkerd |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Advocate** | backend-architect | cloud-architect | deployment-engineer |
| **Pros** | - Feature rich<br>- Large community<br>- Multi-cloud | - AWS native<br>- Managed service<br>- Simple setup | - Lightweight<br>- Fast<br>- Easy to use |

| **Operational Complexity** | High | Low | Medium |
| **Recommendation** | **Selected** - For production | For simple cases | For performance-critical |

**Resolution Rationale**: Istio's feature set (especially for multi-tenancy and security) justifies the complexity for enterprise use.

---

### 6. Documentation Platform
**Status**: RESOLVED

| Aspect | Option A: TechDocs (Built-in) | Option B: Docusaurus | Option C: GitBook |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Advocate** | dx-optimizer | frontend-developer | - |
| **Pros** | - Integrated in Backstage<br>- Single platform<br>- Consistent UX | - Better search<br>- Versioning<br>- Customizable | - SaaS option<br>- Good UX<br>- Collaboration |
| **Cons** | - Limited features<br>- Basic search<br>- MkDocs based | - Separate platform<br>- Maintenance | - Cost<br>- Lock-in<br>- Limited customization |
| **Developer Experience** | Best integration | Good docs experience | Easy editing |
| **Recommendation** | **Selected** - Use TechDocs with enhancements | For public docs | |

**Resolution Rationale**: Keeping documentation within Backstage provides better developer experience despite limitations.
