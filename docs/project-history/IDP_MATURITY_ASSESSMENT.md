# Internal Developer Platform (IDP) Maturity Assessment

## Executive Summary

Your Terraform/Atmos infrastructure demonstrates **Level 2 (Developing)** maturity on the IDP scale, with strong foundations in Infrastructure as Code and workflow automation, but significant gaps in developer self-service, observability, and platform APIs that prevent it from being a complete Internal Developer Platform.

### Maturity Score: 2.3/5.0

| Category | Score | Maturity Level |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Developer Self-Service | 2/5 | Basic |
| Golden Paths | 3/5 | Developing |
| Platform APIs | 1/5 | Initial |
| Observability | 2/5 | Basic |
| Security & Compliance | 3/5 | Developing |
| Developer Experience | 2/5 | Basic |

- **Target**: < 30 minutes via self-service

### MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)
- **Current**: Not measured
- **Target**: < 1 hour with full observability

### Infrastructure Cost
- **Current**: No visibility
- **Target**: 20% reduction through optimization

### Developer Satisfaction
- **Current**: Not measured
- **Target**: > 4.0/5.0 NPS score

## Investment Required

### Tooling Costs (Annual)
- Developer Portal: $50-100k (Backstage Enterprise or Port)
- Observability: $100-200k (Datadog/New Relic)
- FinOps Platform: $50-100k (Kubecost/CloudHealth)
- Security Tools: $50-100k (Snyk/Aqua)

### Engineering Effort
- Platform Team: 4-6 engineers
- Timeline: 12 months to full maturity
- Training: 2 weeks per developer

## Conclusion

Your current infrastructure provides a solid foundation but lacks the abstraction, automation, and developer-facing interfaces needed for a complete IDP. The primary focus should be on:

1. **Creating a developer portal** for self-service
2. **Building platform APIs** for programmatic access
3. **Implementing full observability** for debugging
4. **Establishing golden paths** for common patterns
5. **Adding FinOps capabilities** for cost management

With focused investment over 12 months, you can transform this from an infrastructure automation tool into a true Internal Developer Platform that accelerates development velocity while maintaining security and compliance.
