# Cloud Architecture Optimization Plan
## Terraform/Atmos Infrastructure - Cost & Performance Optimization Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive plan outlines architectural improvements to reduce infrastructure costs by 25-30% while improving performance, scalability, and reliability across all 17 Terraform components. The optimization focuses on right-sizing resources, implementing auto-scaling patterns, leveraging managed services, and establishing cost governance.

**Key Targets:**
- **Cost Reduction**: 25-30% monthly savings (~$15,000-20,000/month)
- **Performance**: 2x improvement in response times
- **Scalability**: Support 10x traffic with no architecture changes
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automated failover
- **Deployment Speed**: Reduce from 8 hours to < 2 hours

## 1. Cost Optimization Architecture

### 1.1 Compute Optimization Strategy

#### EC2 & EKS Right-Sizing
```yaml
optimization_strategy:
  current_state:
    - All instances: On-demand pricing
    - Fixed instance sizes across environments
    - No auto-scaling policies
    - 24/7 runtime for non-production
  
  target_state:
    development:
      instance_strategy: "70% Spot + 30% On-demand"
      auto_shutdown: "Nights and weekends"
      node_groups:
        - name: "spot-workers"
          instance_types: ["t3.medium", "t3a.medium", "t2.medium"]
          spot_max_price: "0.0464"  # 50% of on-demand
          scaling: "1-10 nodes"
        - name: "on-demand-core"
          instance_types: ["t3.small"]
          scaling: "1-3 nodes"
