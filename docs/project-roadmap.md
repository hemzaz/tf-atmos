   - Research containerization approaches for local deployment
   - Assess frontend frameworks (React, Vue, or Svelte)

2. **Rundeck Integration Assessment** (Q3-Q4 2025)
   - Investigate Rundeck integration for workflow automation
   - Compare with custom-built workflow engine
   - Evaluate security implications of different approaches

   - Create containerized deployment model
   - Test local and server deployment scenarios

4. **MVP Implementation** (Q1 2026)
   - Implement first version with core functionality
   - Focus on certificate/SSH key management
   - Develop deployment patterns for team environments

## 7. Known Limitations & Workarounds

Current limitations in the project and how to work around them:

1. **Cross-region resource management**
   - *Limitation*: Components are region-specific
   - *Workaround*: Create separate component instances per region

2. **Large state files**
   - *Limitation*: Performance issues with very large state files
   - *Workaround*: Split components into smaller units with separate state files

3. **IAM policy size limits**
   - *Limitation*: AWS enforces size limits on IAM policies
   - *Workaround*: Use the IAM component's policy splitting feature

4. **Resource quotas**
   - *Limitation*: AWS enforces service quotas that vary by account
   - *Workaround*: Use the quota-request component to automate quota increase requests

5. **Service Mesh Complexity**
   - *Limitation*: Istio increases operational complexity and resource consumption
   - *Workaround*: Implement gradually, starting with core services and critical paths
