# Agent Coordination Framework
## Multi-Agent Orchestration for Terraform/Atmos Infrastructure Platform

---

## 1. Framework Overview

### Purpose
This framework establishes the operational protocols, communication patterns, and coordination mechanisms for 14+ specialized agents working on the Terraform/Atmos infrastructure platform transformation.

### Core Principles
1. **Autonomous Operation**: Agents work independently within defined boundaries
2. **Collaborative Integration**: Seamless handoffs and dependency management
3. **Context Preservation**: Continuous state management across sessions
4. **Conflict Prevention**: Clear ownership and escalation paths
5. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation at every handoff point
