  - Performance tuning and optimization
  - Large-scale deployment strategies

- [ ] **API Reference**
  - Complete function and component reference
  - Schema documentation with validation examples
  - Configuration parameter catalog

## 5. How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to help us achieve the items on this roadmap:

1. **Review Issues**: Check if the feature you want is already being tracked
2. **Create Feature Request**: If not found, create a detailed feature request
3. **Submit PRs**: Contribute code or documentation improvements
4. **Provide Feedback**: Help us prioritize by sharing your needs and use cases

To contribute to any roadmap item:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tf-atmos.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and commit
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Create a pull request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 6. Release Schedule

| Version | Target Date | Major Features |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 1.1.0   | Q2 2025     | Security enhancements, advanced monitoring |
| 1.2.0   | Q3 2025     | Cost management, CI/CD pipeline components |
| 1.3.0   | Q4 2025     | Service catalog, enhanced data services |
| 2.0.0   | Q1 2026     | Multi-cloud support, edge computing |

*Note: This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and evolving priorities.*

## 7. Known Limitations & Workarounds

Current limitations in the project and how to work around them:

1. **Cross-region resource management**
   - *Limitation*: Components are region-specific
   - *Workaround*: Create separate component instances per region

2. **Large state files**
   - *Limitation*: Performance issues with very large state files
   - *Workaround*: Split components into smaller units with separate state files

3. **IAM policy size limits**
   - *Limitation*: AWS enforces size limits on IAM policies
   - *Workaround*: Use the IAM component's policy splitting feature

4. **Resource quotas**
   - *Limitation*: AWS enforces service quotas that vary by account
   - *Workaround*: Use the quota-request component to automate quota increase requests
